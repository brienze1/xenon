# Specification Quality Checklist: MCP Server — Full Xenon Access for AI Clients, Secrets Write-Only

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) — the protocol (MCP), loopback binding and `xenon mcp` command are user-facing product decisions, not implementation; libraries and code layout are left to the plan
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain — transport, access control, leak guard, approvals and the approval bypass were decided by the product owner before writing
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded — FR-015 lists what is never exposed; Assumptions bound remote access and git accounts
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation passed on the first iteration (2026-10-13).
