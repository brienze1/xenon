# Specification Quality Checklist: MCP Tools Declare Their Arguments; Clearer Workspace and Import Errors

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs). The spec names the MCP protocol surface (tools, input schema, error JSON) because that surface is the product here; it names no code structure.
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders (within the limits of a developer-tool feature)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain. The three open decisions were answered by the user (see Clarifications).
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation passed on the first iteration.
